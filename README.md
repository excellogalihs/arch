# Arch Linux + Hyprland Installation Guide (for First-Timers)

This guide walks you from a blank drive to a fully working **Arch Linux + Hyprland** desktop — no prior Arch experience needed.

> **New to Arch?** Unlike Ubuntu or Fedora, Arch doesn't hold your hand — there's no graphical installer, no desktop pre-installed, and no "click Next 5 times" setup. You install it piece by piece from a terminal, which sounds scary but is actually just typing one command at a time and reading what it tells you. This guide explains **what each command does and why**, not just what to type.

## How to read this guide

- 🔧 **Command blocks** are things you type into the terminal, exactly as shown (swap out placeholders like `sdX` for your actual drive name).
- 💡 **Tip** boxes give optional but useful advice.
- ⚠️ **Warning** boxes flag things that can break your system if rushed.
- Every step ends with a **Why?** explanation in plain English — read these even if you just copy-paste the commands.

## What you'll need

- A USB drive (4GB+) with the Arch Linux ISO already flashed onto it (using a tool like [Rufus](https://rufus.ie))
- A working internet connection (Wi-Fi or Ethernet)
- About an hour, and a willingness to read error messages instead of panicking at them

## A few words you'll see a lot

| Term | What it means |
|---|---|
| **Live USB / Live environment** | The temporary Arch system running off your USB drive, before anything is installed to the actual computer |
| **Partition** | A section of your hard drive, like dividing one drawer into two compartments |
| **Mount** | Making a partition accessible at a specific folder path, so you can read/write to it |
| **Chroot** | "Change root" — jumping from the temporary live USB environment *into* the system you're installing, as if you'd already booted into it |
| **Bootloader** | The program that runs first when you power on, and hands control to the Linux kernel (we're using GRUB) |
| **Compositor** | The program that draws windows on screen and manages your desktop (Hyprland, in our case) |
| **AUR** | The Arch User Repository — a community-run collection of build scripts for software that isn't in the official Arch repos |

Everything below assumes you've already booted from the Arch ISO and you're staring at a terminal prompt that looks like `root@archiso ~ #`.

# Part 1 — Installing Arch Linux

## 1. Connect to the Internet

First, check whether you're already online:

```bash
ping archlinux.org
```

If you see replies coming back (lines with `bytes from`), you're connected — press `Ctrl+C` to stop the ping and skip to Step 2.

If you're on Wi-Fi and see nothing, connect manually with `iwctl` (Arch's built-in Wi-Fi tool):

```bash
iwctl
device list
station wlan0 scan
station wlan0 get-networks
station wlan0 connect "YOUR_WIFI_NAME"
exit
```

> 💡 **Tip:** `device list` shows your Wi-Fi adapter's name — it's usually `wlan0`, but double-check it matches what's listed before continuing.

**Why?** The installer doesn't come with anything pre-downloaded — every package (the base system, the kernel, your desktop) is fetched live from Arch's servers. No internet, no install.

---

## 2. Find Your Drive

```bash
lsblk
```

This lists every storage device attached to your computer, something like:

```text
sda        238.5G  ← an external or secondary drive
nvme0n1    476.9G  ← usually your main internal SSD
```

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Getting this wrong means installing Arch over the wrong drive and losing its data. Check the size (`238.5G`, `476.9G`, etc.) against what you know about your hardware before moving on. If unsure, unplug any drive you don't want touched.

**Why?** You need to tell the installer exactly which physical drive to use — it won't guess for you.

---

## 3. Partition the Drive

```bash
cfdisk /dev/sdX
```

Replace `sdX` with your actual drive name from Step 2 (e.g. `/dev/sda` or `/dev/nvme0n1`).

Inside `cfdisk`, create two partitions:

| Partition | Size | Type |
|---|---:|---|
| EFI System | 512 MB | EFI System |
| Linux Filesystem | Remaining space | Linux filesystem |

Use the arrow keys to navigate, `[New]` to create a partition, and set the **EFI System** type on the first one. When done, select **[Write]** → type `yes` to confirm → **[Quit]**.

**Why?** The EFI partition stores the small files your motherboard's firmware needs to find and start Linux. The second, much larger partition is where Arch itself and all your files will actually live.

---

## 4. Format the Partitions

```bash
mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sdX1
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdX2
```

`sdX1` is your EFI partition, `sdX2` is your Linux filesystem partition (match the numbers `cfdisk` showed you).

**Why?** Creating partitions just draws the boundaries — formatting is what actually lays down a filesystem (a way of organizing files) inside each one. FAT32 is required for the EFI partition by the UEFI standard; ext4 is Linux's reliable, general-purpose filesystem.

---

## 5. Mount the Partitions

```bash
mount /dev/sdX2 /mnt
mkdir /mnt/boot
mount /dev/sdX1 /mnt/boot
```

**Why?** "Mounting" tells the live environment: *"when I write to `/mnt`, actually write to this partition."* The installer (`pacstrap`, next step) only knows how to install to `/mnt` — mounting is what connects that folder to your real drive.

---

## 6. Install the Base System

```bash
pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-firmware
```

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `base` | The essential command-line tools every Arch system needs |
| `linux` | The Linux kernel — the core that talks to your hardware |
| `linux-firmware` | Extra firmware files many devices (Wi-Fi cards, GPUs) need to function |

**Why?** This is the actual "installation" step — everything before this was just preparing empty space. This one command downloads and copies a minimal, bootable Linux system onto your drive.

---

## 7. Install Essential Packages

```bash
pacstrap /mnt networkmanager grub efibootmgr sudo nvim
```

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `networkmanager` | Handles Wi-Fi and Ethernet once you're no longer on the live USB |
| `grub` | The bootloader — what actually boots into your new system |
| `efibootmgr` | Registers GRUB with your motherboard's UEFI firmware |
| `sudo` | Lets your regular user run administrator-level commands when needed |
| `nvim` | A text editor for editing config files (you'll use this constantly) |

**Why?** The base system from Step 6 is deliberately minimal — it can't even connect to Wi-Fi or boot on its own yet. These packages fill in those gaps.

---

## 8. Generate the Filesystem Table (fstab)

```bash
genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
```

**Why?** `fstab` is a file that tells Linux which partition to mount where, every time it boots. `genfstab` writes this automatically based on how you mounted things in Step 5 — you'd otherwise have to write it by hand.

---

## 9. Enter Your New System (chroot)

```bash
arch-chroot /mnt
```

**Why?** So far you've been working *from* the live USB, treating `/mnt` as a subfolder. `arch-chroot` jumps you *inside* the system you just installed, so from here on, commands run as if you'd actually booted into your new Arch install — because for all practical purposes, you now have.

---

## 10. Set Your Timezone

```bash
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Jakarta /etc/localtime
hwclock --systohc
```

Replace `Asia/Jakarta` with your own region — run `ls /usr/share/zoneinfo` to browse available options.

**Why?** This tells Linux what time zone to display clocks in, and syncs your hardware clock so the time stays correct after reboot.

---

## 11. Configure Your Locale

```bash
nvim /etc/locale.gen
```

Find the line `#en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8` and remove the `#` at the start to uncomment it. Save and quit (`:wq`).

Then:

```bash
locale-gen
echo "LANG=en_US.UTF-8" > /etc/locale.conf
```

**Why?** "Locale" controls language, character encoding, and formatting (dates, currency, etc.) system-wide. Uncommenting a locale in `locale.gen` tells Arch to actually generate that language pack; `locale.conf` tells the system which one to use by default.

---

## 12. Set Your Hostname

```bash
echo "arch" > /etc/hostname
```

**Why?** The hostname is your machine's name on a network — useful for identifying it, especially if you have more than one computer around.

---

## 13. Configure Hosts File

```bash
nvim /etc/hosts
```

Add these three lines:

```text
127.0.0.1 localhost
::1 localhost
127.0.1.1 arch.localdomain arch
```

**Why?** This lets your own machine resolve its own hostname locally, without needing to ask a DNS server — some programs expect this to work even with no internet.

---

## 14. Set the Root Password

```bash
passwd
```

You'll be prompted to type a password twice (it won't show on screen — that's normal).

**Why?** `root` is Arch's built-in administrator account. Right now it has no password at all, which is a security hole you're closing here.

---

## 15. Create Your Own User Account

```bash
useradd -m -G wheel -s /bin/zsh excello
passwd excello
```

Replace `excello` with whatever username you want.

**Why?** You shouldn't do your daily computing as `root` — one typo could wreck your whole system. `-m` creates a home folder for this user, `-G wheel` puts them in the `wheel` group (needed for admin permissions, next step), and `-s /bin/zsh` sets zsh as their shell from the start.

---

## 16. Enable `sudo` for Your User

```bash
EDITOR=nvim visudo
```

Find the line `# %wheel ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL` and remove the `#`. Save and quit.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Always edit this file with `visudo`, never a plain text editor — it checks your syntax before saving, so a typo can't lock you out of `sudo` entirely.

**Why?** This tells Linux "anyone in the `wheel` group can use `sudo`." Since your user is in `wheel` (Step 15), this is what lets you run admin commands like `sudo pacman -Syu` instead of switching to `root` every time.

---

## 17. Install the Bootloader (GRUB)

```bash
grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot --bootloader-id=GRUB
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

**Why?** Installing the `grub` package (Step 7) only put the program on disk — these two commands actually register it with your UEFI firmware and generate its boot menu configuration. Without this, your computer has no idea how to start Linux at all.

---

## 18. Install Hyprland and Desktop Essentials

```bash
pacman -S hyprland hyprpaper hyprpolkitagent sddm pipewire pipewire-pulse wireplumber kitty zsh zsh-autosuggestions zsh-syntax-highlighting starship waybar network-manager-applet ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd nvim yazi fzf bat fastfetch
```

Grouped by what each thing does:

**Desktop itself**
| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `hyprland` | The Wayland compositor — this *is* your desktop environment |
| `hyprpaper` | Sets your wallpaper |
| `hyprpolkitagent` | Handles password prompts for admin actions triggered from GUI apps |

**Login screen**
| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `sddm` | The graphical login screen you'll see on every boot |

**Audio**
| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `pipewire` | Modern Linux audio server |
| `pipewire-pulse` | Compatibility layer so apps expecting PulseAudio still work |
| `wireplumber` | Manages audio devices and routing behind the scenes |

**Terminal & shell**
| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `kitty` | A fast, GPU-accelerated terminal emulator |
| `zsh` | An alternative shell to `bash`, with more features |
| `zsh-autosuggestions` | Ghost-text command suggestions as you type |
| `zsh-syntax-highlighting` | Colors commands as valid/invalid while typing |
| `starship` | A customizable, informative shell prompt |

**Bar & tray**
| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `waybar` | The status bar along the top/bottom of your screen |
| `network-manager-applet` | A Wi-Fi icon/menu in your tray |

**Fonts**
| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd` | A coding font patched with icons (needed for waybar/kitty icons to render) |

**CLI tools**
| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `nvim` | Text editor |
| `yazi` | Terminal file manager |
| `fzf` | Fuzzy finder for files, history, and more |
| `bat` | A nicer `cat`, with syntax highlighting |
| `fastfetch` | Prints a system-info summary with ASCII art |

> 💡 **Tip:** This one command installs everything at once. If it fails partway through (e.g. a mirror timing out), just re-run the same command — `pacman` skips anything already installed.

**Why this order?** Each layer depends on the one above it conceptually: the compositor needs to exist before a login manager can launch it, audio needs to exist before a terminal cares about it, and fonts need to be present before the bar/terminal can render icons correctly. Installing in this order isn't strictly required by `pacman`, but it mirrors the order you'll actually configure things in Part 2.

---

## 19. Enable Background Services

```bash
systemctl enable NetworkManager
systemctl enable sddm
```

**Why?** Installing a package doesn't automatically make it start on boot — `systemctl enable` is what schedules a service to launch every time you power on. Without this, you'd have no networking and no login screen after rebooting.

---

## 20. Finish Up

```bash
exit
umount -R /mnt
poweroff
```

Once it powers off, physically remove your USB drive.

**Why?** `exit` leaves the chroot environment, `umount -R /mnt` safely detaches your new system's partitions (skipping this can corrupt files), and `poweroff` shuts the machine down cleanly so you can boot from the actual drive next.

---

## 21. First Boot

```text
Power Button → UEFI → GRUB → SDDM → Hyprland → Desktop
```

If you land on the SDDM login screen, log in with the user you created in Step 15. You should land on a mostly-empty Hyprland desktop — that's expected. Part 2 turns it from "working" into "yours."

---

# Part 2 — Post-Installation Configuration

You're on the desktop now. Everything below is about making things look and behave the way you want, one piece at a time.

> 💡 **A recurring pattern:** most of these programs read their settings from a plain text file under `~/.config/`. You'll open that file in `nvim`, change something, save, and often the change applies immediately (or after a quick reload command) — no restarting the whole desktop needed.

---

## 22. Clean Up `hyprland.lua`

Hyprland's config file lives at `~/.config/hypr/hyprland.lua` and is written in **Lua** (a small, readable scripting language), not a special Hyprland-only format.

Open it:

```bash
nvim ~/.config/hypr/hyprland.lua
```

Near the top you'll see this line:

```lua
hl.config({ autogenerated = true })
```

Delete that entire line. It's the only thing causing the yellow "unmodified config" warning banner you'll see on your desktop right now.

**Why?** Hyprland auto-generates this file the first time it runs, and flags it as untouched so you know to customize it. Once you've started editing (which you're doing right now), that flag no longer serves a purpose.

> 💡 **Tip:** As this file grows, you can split it into smaller files and pull them in with Lua's `require()`:
> ```lua
> require("modules.keybinds")  -- loads ~/.config/hypr/modules/keybinds.lua
> ```
> Each file loads in its own little sandbox, so a mistake in one won't break the rest.

---

## 23. Install an AUR Helper (yay)

Everything you've installed so far came from the **official Arch repositories** via `pacman`. But a huge amount of Linux software — browsers with extra patches, proprietary apps, niche CLI tools, in-development packages — lives instead in the **AUR (Arch User Repository)**: a community-maintained collection of build recipes (`PKGBUILD` files), not pre-built binaries. `pacman` doesn't know how to touch the AUR at all — you need a separate tool called an **AUR helper** to download, build, and install from it as easily as you use `pacman`.

First, install the tools needed to actually *build* software from source:

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel git
```

Then clone and build `yay` itself (yay is an AUR package too, so it's installed "by hand" this one time):

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay
makepkg -si
cd ..
rm -rf yay
```

| Package/Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `base-devel` | A package group bundling `gcc`, `make`, `patch`, and other tools needed to compile source code |
| `git` | Needed to download (`clone`) both `yay`'s source and, later, any AUR package's source |
| `makepkg -si` | Builds the package from its `PKGBUILD` (`-s` also grabs and installs any missing dependencies first) and `-i` installs the resulting package once it's built |

Once installed, using `yay` feels just like `pacman`, except it searches both the official repos *and* the AUR:

```bash
yay -S somepackage     # install a package (official or AUR)
yay -Syu                # update everything, official repos + AUR, in one go
yay -Ss keyword          # search by name/description
```

> ⚠️ **Warning:** AUR packages are user-submitted build scripts, not vetted by Arch the way official packages are. `makepkg`/`yay` will always show you the `PKGBUILD` before building — actually skim it, especially for less popular packages, since it's just a script that runs with your permissions.

### `yay` vs `paru` — which one should you use?

Both are AUR helpers that do the same core job (search, download, build, install, and keep AUR + official packages updated together), and both were originally written by the same author, so day-to-day usage feels nearly identical. The differences are mostly under the hood:

| | `yay` | `paru` |
|---|---|---|
| **Written in** | Go | Rust |
| **Age / ecosystem** | Older, the long-time default in most Arch guides and tutorials | Newer "spiritual successor," written after the author moved on from `yay` |
| **PKGBUILD review** | Shows diffs on update; review step is easy to skim past | Defaults to a more insistent interactive review before building, which some find safer, others find naggy |
| **Config style** | Command-line flags, a `~/.config/yay/config.json` | Similar flags, plus a `~/.config/paru/paru.conf` with a few extra knobs (e.g. batch installs, dedicated cleanup commands) |
| **Maintenance** | Stable, feature-complete, in wide use | Actively developed, tends to pick up newer conveniences first |

**Why does this matter?** Neither is objectively "better" — they solve the exact same problem and can even be swapped later without side effects, since both just wrap `makepkg`. This guide uses `yay` because it's what most beginner tutorials and community dotfiles reference, so troubleshooting help is easier to find. If you'd rather use `paru` instead, the install steps are identical, just swap the repository URL:

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/paru.git
cd paru
makepkg -si
cd ..
rm -rf paru
```

---

## 24. Set a Wallpaper with Hyprpaper

Hyprpaper's config lives at `~/.config/hypr/hyprpaper.conf`.

```bash
nvim ~/.config/hypr/hyprpaper.conf
```

Add:

```ini
wallpaper {
    monitor = DP-3
    path = ~/myFile.jxl
    fit_mode = cover
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `monitor` | Which screen this applies to. Run `hyprctl monitors` in a terminal to see your monitor's real name (e.g. `eDP-1` for a laptop screen). Leave it blank for a fallback that covers any monitor without a specific entry. |
| `path` | The image file to use. |
| `fit_mode` | How the image fills the screen: `cover` (fill and crop), `contain` (fit without cropping), `tile`, or `fill` (stretch). Defaults to `cover`. |

Got two monitors? Just add a second block:

```ini
wallpaper {
    monitor = DP-3
    path = ~/Pictures/wall1.jxl
    fit_mode = cover
}

wallpaper {
    monitor = DP-2
    path = ~/Pictures/wall2.jxl
    fit_mode = cover
}
```

To make hyprpaper start automatically every login, add this line to `hyprland.lua` (from Step 22):

```lua
hl.exec_cmd("hyprpaper")
```

If you change the wallpaper config later without restarting anything:

```bash
hyprctl hyprpaper reload
```

---

## 25. Turn On `hyprpolkitagent`

This one has no config file — it just needs to be *running*. It's what lets password prompts actually appear when a graphical app asks for admin permission (installing something with a GUI, mounting a drive, etc).

Add this to `hyprland.lua`, alongside the hyprpaper line from Step 24:

```lua
hl.exec_cmd("hyprpolkitagent")
```

Check it's running:

```bash
pgrep -a hyprpolkitagent
```

If that prints a line with a process ID, it's working.

---

## 26. Pick a Kitty Theme

Kitty (your terminal) has a built-in theme browser — no config file editing required:

```bash
kitten themes
```

Use the arrow keys or type to search, preview a theme live, and press `Enter` to apply it.

**Why does this "just work"?** Behind the scenes it saves the theme to `~/.config/kitty/current-theme.conf` and quietly links it into your `kitty.conf` for you.

After picking one, either restart kitty or reload it live with `Ctrl+Shift+F5`.

```bash
kitten choose-fonts
```

**Why?** It makes the terminal more comfortable and futuristic.

After selecting a font, you can restart kitty.

---

## 27. Add Both Zsh Plugins

Open your zsh config:

```bash
nvim ~/.zshrc
```

Add these two lines:

```bash
source /usr/share/zsh/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh
source /usr/share/zsh/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh
```

> ⚠️ **Order matters:** keep `zsh-syntax-highlighting` sourced *last* among your plugins — it hooks deeply into how zsh handles what you type, and other plugins loaded after it can quietly break the highlighting.

**What each one actually does:**
- **zsh-autosuggestions** — as you type, it shows a faint, greyed-out guess of the rest of the command based on your history. Press the `→` right-arrow key to accept it.
- **zsh-syntax-highlighting** — colors what you're typing green if it's a valid, runnable command, and red if it isn't — so you catch typos before hitting Enter.

---

## 28. Choose a Starship Prompt Preset

Starship comes with several ready-made prompt styles so you don't have to design one from scratch.

See what's available:

```bash
starship preset --list
```

Save one as your active config — for example, the Nerd Font icons preset:

```bash
starship preset nerd-font-symbols -o ~/.config/starship.toml
```

Then make sure Starship is actually turned on (this line is also covered in Step 33's full `.zshrc` walkthrough):

```bash
eval "$(starship init zsh)"
```

**Why?** `starship preset <name> -o <file>` writes a complete, working `starship.toml` for you. You can open that file later in `nvim` and tweak individual pieces once you know what you like.

---

## 29. A Minimal Waybar Setup That Actually Works

Waybar reads two files: `~/.config/waybar/config.jsonc` (what to show) and `~/.config/waybar/style.css` (how it looks).

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/waybar
nvim ~/.config/waybar/config.jsonc
```

```jsonc
{
    "layer": "top",
    "modules-left": ["hyprland/workspaces", "custom/media-animation", "custom/media-playing"],
    "modules-center": ["clock"],
    "modules-right": ["pulseaudio", "network", "cpu", "memory"],
    "battery": {
        "format": "{capacity}% {icon}",
        "format-icons": ["", "", "", "", ""]
    },
    "clock": {
        "format": "󰥔 {:%a, %d. %b  %H:%M}"
    },
    "cpu": {
        "format": " {}%"
    },
    "hyprland/workspaces": {
        "persistent-workspaces": {
            "*": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        }
    },
    "memory": {
        "format": " {}%"
    },
    "network": {
        "format": "  {essid}",
        "tooltip": false,
    },
    "pulseaudio": {
        "format": "{icon} {volume}%",
        "format-icons": {
            "default": ["", " ", " "]
        },
        "scroll-step": 2
    },
```

Then the styling:

```bash
nvim ~/.config/waybar/style.css
```

```css
* {
    font-family: "JetBrainsMono Nerd Font";
    font-size: 13px;
    min-height: 0;
}

window#waybar {
    background-color: rgba(20, 20, 30, 0.85);
    color: #cdd6f4;
}

#workspaces button {
    padding: 0 8px;
    color: #cdd6f4;
}

#workspaces button.active {
    background-color: #89b4fa;
    color: #1e1e2e;
    border-radius: 6px;
}

#clock, #network, #pulseaudio, #battery, #tray {
    padding: 0 10px;
}
```

Make it launch automatically by adding this to `hyprland.lua`:

```lua
hl.exec_cmd("waybar")
```

**Why laid out this way?** `modules-left/center/right` are the bar's three zones. Workspaces go on the left (near your window list), the clock sits center (glanceable at a distance), and system status — network, volume, battery, tray icons — groups on the right, matching the layout most desktop bars use.

---

## 30. Connect to Wi-Fi Day-to-Day with `nmtui`

```bash
nmtui
```

A simple text menu opens:

1. Choose **Activate a connection**
2. Arrow down to your Wi-Fi network, press `Enter`
3. Type the password when asked
4. It'll show as connected in the list

**Why not `iwctl` again?** `iwctl` (from Step 1) only works inside the temporary live USB environment. Now that `networkmanager` is installed and running, `nmtui` is its friendly menu — and unlike `iwctl`, it remembers networks and reconnects automatically every time you boot.

To just check your connection status without the menu:

```bash
nmcli device status
```

---

## 31. Neovim Basics

`nvim` has a few different "modes" — this trips up a lot of first-timers coming from Notepad-style editors, so here's the short version:

| Mode | How to enter it | What it's for |
|---|---|---|
| **Normal** | Press `Esc` | The default mode — moving around and running commands, *not* typing |
| **Insert** | Press `i` | Actually typing text |
| **Visual** | Press `v` | Selecting text |
| **Command** | Press `:` | Typing commands like save or quit |

Basic movement (while in Normal mode): `h` `j` `k` `l` move left/down/up/right, `w` jumps forward a word, `gg` jumps to the top of the file, `G` jumps to the bottom.

The commands you'll use constantly:

```vim
:w        " save the file
:q        " quit (fails if you have unsaved changes)
:wq       " save and quit together
:q!       " quit and throw away unsaved changes
/searchterm    " search forward for text, press n for next match
```

> 💡 **Tip:** If you ever get stuck and don't know what mode you're in, just press `Esc` a couple of times — that always gets you back to Normal mode safely.

Its own config lives at `~/.config/nvim/init.lua` — also Lua, so the skills carry over from `hyprland.lua`.

## 32. Yazi Basics

Yazi is a terminal-based file manager — think of it as a fast, keyboard-driven alternative to a Files/Finder window.

```bash
yazi
```

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `h` `j` `k` `l` | Move left / down / up / right (same as nvim) |
| `Enter` | Open a file, or step into a folder |
| `Space` | Select/deselect a file |
| `y` then `p` | Copy, then paste |
| `d` | Cut (move) |
| `a` | Create a new file or folder |
| `r` | Rename |
| `Tab` | Toggle the preview pane |
| `q` | Quit |

## 33. fzf's Hidden Superpowers, and Building Out `.zshrc`

Once fzf is sourced into your shell, it adds keyboard shortcuts that work anywhere on the command line:

| Shortcut | What happens |
|---|---|
| `Ctrl+R` | Fuzzy-search your command **history** — type a couple of letters instead of pressing ↑ repeatedly |
| `Ctrl+T` | Fuzzy-**find a file or folder** and drop its path at your cursor |
| `Alt+C` | Fuzzy-`cd` straight into any subfolder |
| `something **<Tab>` | Fuzzy-completes an argument — e.g. `nvim **<Tab>` |

You can also chain it with other commands: `git checkout $(git branch | fzf)` lets you fuzzy-pick a branch to switch to.

Here's the `.zshrc` block, explained line by line:

```bash
eval "$(starship init zsh)"
export EDITOR='nvim'
source <(fzf --zsh)
source /usr/share/zsh/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting/zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh
source /usr/share/zsh/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions/zsh-autosuggestions.zsh
HISTFILE=~/.zsh_history
HISTSIZE=10000
SAVEHIST=10000
setopt SHARE_HISTORY
setopt HIST_IGNORE_ALL_DUPS
alias update='sudo pacman -Syu'
alias search='nvim $(fzf --preview="bat --color=always {}")'
```

| Line | Plain-English explanation |
|---|---|
| `eval "$(starship init zsh)"` | Turns on the Starship prompt you configured in Step 28. Keeping it near the top avoids conflicts with anything loaded after it. |
| `export EDITOR='nvim'` | Tells other programs (like `git commit` or `sudo -e`) to open `nvim` instead of defaulting to `vi`. |
| `source <(fzf --zsh)` | Loads fzf's keyboard shortcuts (`Ctrl+R`, `Ctrl+T`, `Alt+C`) straight from your installed fzf binary. |
| `source .../zsh-syntax-highlighting.zsh` | Turns on the red/green live syntax highlighting from Step 27. |
| `source .../zsh-autosuggestions.zsh` | Turns on the ghost-text history suggestions from Step 27. |
| `HISTFILE=~/.zsh_history` | The file where your command history gets saved permanently, instead of vanishing when you close the terminal. |
| `HISTSIZE=10000` | How many past commands zsh keeps in memory while you're using it. |
| `SAVEHIST=10000` | How many of those get actually written to `HISTFILE` on disk. |
| `setopt SHARE_HISTORY` | Every open terminal window shares one live history — run something in one tab, and pressing ↑ in another tab sees it instantly. |
| `setopt HIST_IGNORE_ALL_DUPS` | Skips saving a command to history if it's an exact repeat of the one right before it. |
| `alias update='sudo pacman -Syu'` | A shortcut — type `update` instead of the full pacman upgrade command. |
| `alias search='nvim $(fzf --preview="bat --color=always {}")'` | Fuzzy-find a file with a preview, then open it directly in `nvim` — two steps in one word. |

> 💡 **Tip:** Group your `source` lines together near the top of the file, and keep aliases/history settings below them — it makes the file much easier to scan later once it grows.

> 💡 **Tip:** Now that `yay` (Step 23) is set up, you can add `alias yayu='yay -Syu'` here too — a single command that updates official packages and AUR packages together.
